Head Tracker

The Head Tracker project is a head tracking solution for UAV payload control as well as FPV R/C flying.

The sensor system (OceanServer OS5000-US) consists of accelerometers to detect pitch and roll, and a magnetometer to detect yaw.

The serial datastream is sent to a Robostix board which controls two servos mounted on a pan and tilt assembly.  Only the pitch and roll data is used to drive the pan and tilt system.
